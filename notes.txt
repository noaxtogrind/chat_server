< tcp controller design 5/8/14 >

tcp controller design is extremely limited; in more sophisticated pattern you might have:
- state arg passed from supervisor with module name
- controller:handle() returning value for updating of gen_server state
- controller exposing accept, disconnect handlers to gen_server
